## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various sales promotion problems utilizing predictive analysis and optimization techniques.

## Solutions Summary

### 1. Predictive Analysis:

Utilized predictive analysis to establish the relationship between sales, price, and advertising budget. Derived the equation: `Sales = -142.54(Price) + 0.102257(Ads Budget) + 3092.883`.

### 2. Sales Prediction for Given Scenarios:

Predicted sales for specific scenarios:
- When the price is $20 and the advertising budget is $1700: Sales = 1942 units
- When the price is $10 and the advertising budget is $3500: Sales = 2025 units

### 3. Optimization to Maximize Sales:

Utilized optimization techniques to maximize sales while considering constraints such as minimum profit, maximum budget, and minimum budget. Found the optimum values for price and advertising budget to maximize sales: Price = $15.17, Ads Budget = $10,000, Sales = $1953.45, Profit = $4000.

### 4. Maximizing Profit:

Identified the best strategy to maximize profit by considering constraints such as limited advertising budget. Found that without investing in ads, maximizing profit can be achieved by increasing the selling price to $14.85.

### 5. Achieving a Target Profit:

Determined the optimal values for price and advertising budget to achieve a profit of $100,000 while considering constraints such as sales limit and minimum advertising budget. Found that to achieve a profit of $100,000, the price should be increased to $43.99, focusing more on price increment rather than increasing the advertising budget excessively.



Each solution provided in this repository aims to address specific objectives and constraints related to sales promotion, utilizing analytical and optimization techniques for decision-making.
